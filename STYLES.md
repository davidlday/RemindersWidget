# A Guide to Widget Styling

tl;dr - This widget uses external styles to allow for tweaking the look and feel with minimal disruption to the core widget logic. If you want to change the look and feel, make your own ```custom.css``` file, drop it in the ```styles``` directory, and update the ```styleFilename``` setting in ```reminders.coffee```.

If you want to contribute the style back, rename the file to something other than ```custom.css``` and submit a pull request.
